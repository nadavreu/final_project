# PulseVision - Real-Time Heart Rate Measurement from Video

PulseVision is a real-time heart rate monitoring system that uses remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) to detect heart rate from video of a person's face, without any physical contact or sensors.

## Features
- **Real-time video capture** from webcam or video files
- **Advanced face detection** using MediaPipe Face Mesh (468 landmarks)
- **Multi-ROI tracking** of forehead and cheek regions with dynamic weighting
- **Robust heart rate measurement** using FFT-based frequency analysis:
  - Green channel extraction for optimal blood volume detection
  - Advanced signal preprocessing and noise filtering
  - Real-time signal quality assessment
  - Confidence-based measurement validation
- **Comprehensive GUI** with real-time visualization:
  - Live video feed with colored ROI overlays
  - Real-time heart rate display with confidence indicators
  - Three synchronized plots: rPPG signal, heart rate trend, FFT spectrum
  - Method indicator showing "FFT" analysis
- **Patient management system** with database integration
- **High accuracy**: Within 2-3 BPM of reference devices (tested vs Apple Watch ECG)

## Technical Details

### Signal Processing Pipeline

The rPPG heart rate measurement follows an 11-step pipeline:

1. **Input Video** - Capture video from webcam or file
2. **Face Detection** - Use MediaPipe to detect 468 facial landmarks
3. **ROI Tracking** - Track forehead and cheek regions with stability monitoring
4. **Green Channel Extraction** - Extract green color intensity for optimal blood volume detection
5. **Multi-ROI Signal Combination** - Combine signals from multiple regions with dynamic weighting
6. **Signal Preprocessing** - Filter and clean the signal:
   - CLAHE enhancement for lighting normalization
   - Motion artifact removal using MAD-based outlier detection
   - Bandpass filtering (0.67-3.0 Hz for 40-180 BPM)
   - Notch filtering for power line interference
7. **Heart Rate Estimation** - Use FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to find heart rate frequency:
   - Welch's Power Spectral Density analysis
   - Peak detection in heart rate band (0.5-3.0 Hz)
   - Confidence calculation based on peak quality and signal quality
8. **Signal Quality Assessment** - Evaluate signal reliability:
   - SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) analysis
   - Peak clarity assessment
   - Temporal consistency checking
9. **Heart Rate Filtering** - Smooth and validate results:
   - Physiological range validation (40-180 BPM)
   - Outlier rejection using Z-score analysis
   - Temporal smoothing with moving average
10. **FFT Visualization** - Display frequency spectrum for analysis
11. **GUI Display** - Show real-time results with three synchronized plots

### Performance Features
